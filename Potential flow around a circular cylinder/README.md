## Project Description

The project simulates the classical problem of a viscosity-free, incompressible fluid flowing over a transverse cylinder. The animation of the flow is generated base on the solution. The simulation report from Ansys is attached for reference.

## About meshing

The meshing for this project includes only the fluid part. This project was meshed using polyhedra to reduce the number of cells and to improve the quality.

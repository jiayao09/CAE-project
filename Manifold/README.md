## Project Description

This project analyzed the overall pressure and velocity of a manifold with three inlets and one outlet (figure below). The results are considered accurate because the sum of the mass flow rate at the inlet and the mass flow rate at the outlet are equal, and the residuals of the solution meet the desired value. The simulation report from Ansys is attached for reference.

## About meshing

The meshing for this project includes both soild and fluid part for further analysis. This project was meshed using polyhedra to reduce the number of cells and to improve the quality.

## Parallel Computing in the Geometric Design of Axial Flow Pump Impeller Blades
# Abstract
Optimization of airfoil shape using parameterization method is becoming a trend in design of blades for
turbomachines and aircraft. Parameterization methodwork with parameterization of airfoil working
condition, i.e. representation of airfoil with the help of some parameters which control its shape. To
characterize the airfoil with appropriate parameters and explicit or implicit mathematical functions is
one of the challenges in this discipline. The airfoil form is dependent on the axial flow pump parameter,
and this project discusses using a Bezier curve to simulate an airfoil 791. OpenMP was used to handle
numerous control point sets and multiple linear equations simultaneously for the caculation of an
impeller blade. Control points are exported to a txt file to create an STL file that can be utilized with a
variety of CAD programs or analysis tools.

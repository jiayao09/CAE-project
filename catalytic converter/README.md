## Project Description
The project included a study of the effect of the honeycomb ceramic structure inside the catalytic converter on the 
pressure and velocity of Nitrogen fluid. The honeycomb ceramic structure is considered to be a complete fluid and is defined as a porous medium model in the solution section.The simulation report from Ansys is attached for reference.

## About meshing

The meshing for this project includes both soild and fluid part for further analysis. This project was meshed using polyhedra to reduce the number of cells and to improve the quality. A local size is added for the sensor with a mesh size of 1.2 mm.
